# Architectural Decision Records (ADR)
An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs serve as a lightweight documentation method to track the history of architectural decisions in a project and provide clarity to team members about why specific decisions were made.

### Why Use ADRs?
- **Traceability**: ADRs provide traceable records of architectural decisions.
- **Transparency**: They allow all team members to understand the reasoning behind a decision.
- **Accountability**: They make the decision-making process explicit.
- **History**: ADRs preserve the decision-making process, which can be helpful when maintaining or refactoring the system.

### ADR Structure
Each ADR typically includes the following sections:

1. **Title**: A short but descriptive title.
2. **Date**: The date the decision was made.
3. **Status**: Current status of the decision (e.g., proposed, accepted, deprecated).
4. **Context**: The context or problem statement that prompted the decision.
5. **Decision**: The decision made, along with reasons.
6. **Consequences**: The positive and negative consequences of the decision.
